### What is this?
DocsCord is a friendly, easy-to-digest guide to getting started with the basics of using Discord, a text 
and voice communication platform for gamers.

This project was created by [Chloe Glave](https://github.com/Cragzu/) and [Jacky Lau](https://github.com/JackyLau01/)
as part of our studies in Computer Systems Technology at BCIT. We developed our skills in writing documentation for
software, as well as the use of GitHub and Jekyll website themes.

The original [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) Jekyll theme was created by Patrick Marsceill.
