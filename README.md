## Overview

DocsCord is a friendly, easy-to-digest guide to getting started with the basics of using [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), 
a text and voice communication platform for gamers.

The project includes three sets of instructions detailing how to use some of Discord’s main features:

* Making a Discord server
* Using Voice Chat
* Enhancing your messages

There are also three supplementary pages rounding out the website:

* Introduction
* Glossary
* Troubleshooting

This guide is intended for moderately proficient computer users, who are comfortable navigating basic Windows software 
applications and games but may have never used Discord before.

## Creating the project

Although the main goal of this assignment was to develop our skills in writing documentation for software, 
we learned much more along the way.

We forked a pre-existing GitHub repository with a Jekyll website theme for a starting point; this required us to 
explore the codebase and figure out how to modify it to meet our needs. We became more confident with some advanced 
features of Git version control through practice.

To edit files, we used the GitHub online editor to make small, quick tweaks, turning to the more robust WebStorm IDE 
for major modifications. Having flexibility to move between different tools was useful for our productivity.

## Working together

This project was created by [Chloe Glave](https://github.com/Cragzu/) and [Jacky Lau](https://github.com/JackyLau01/) 
as part of our studies in Computer Systems Technology at BCIT. 

Working together was a challenge at times; we completed the guide while studying remotely due to campus 
closure as a result of COVID-19. 

We saw it fitting to use Discord as our primary means of communication throughout the project. We also used Slack 
to keep in touch with our instructor. When working together from home, good communication is especially important, 
so we made sure to check in regularly and write descriptive Git commit messages to keep track of our progress. We 
divided up the work into self-contained pieces so we could complete it at our own pace and 
neither relied on the other too heavily.

## Style and conventions

In order to gain a better understanding of working with Markdown files, we completed several activities prior to 
beginning the project. We examined the style of docs in the original Git repository we had forked; this gave us some 
guidance in our layout and formatting.

Once we had a solid grasp of Markdown, we agreed upon writing style and conventions in order to speak with a unified 
voice throughout the instructions. We proofread each others’ work to ensure that it met our standards.

We defined several typographical conventions to help with clarity and conciseness:

* Exact names of buttons, labels, and terminology in Discord, such as the text that would appear on a tooltip 
when hovering the mouse over a button, are written in **bold**.
* Actions and names of features within Discord, such as “channels” or “servers”, are written in *italics*.
* Instructions are written in sequential numbered and lettered lists in order to be easy to follow; 
each section is also self-contained, so you shouldn’t need to read them in any particular order.
* Points of interest within images and screenshots are highlighted with red boxes.

## Conclusion and Credits

Through creating the website, we honed many valuable skills such as our technical writing, understanding and building 
upon an existing project through GitHub, and working together smoothly when meeting in person was not an option. 
Thank you for reading, and we hope that our instructions help you become more confident with Discord.

Please note that this documentation is *unofficial* and that we are not affiliated with Discord in any way.
