## What is this?

---
## Who are you?

In this documentation, we’re assuming that you are a moderately proficient computer user. Discord is primarily meant 
for video gamers, so you likely have some experience with games; however, it’s okay if you’re brand-new to Discord.

To get the most out of these instructions, you should:

* Be comfortable with mouse and keyboard (simple key commands like **Ctrl+C**, **Ctrl+V**, left and right click)
* Own and know how to use audio input and output devices, such as a headset with a microphone
* Have experience using basic Windows software applications (e.g. Chrome, Steam, Spotify)

---
## What conventions do these instructions use?

These instructions use the following typographical conventions to help with clarity and conciseness:

* Exact names of buttons, labels, and terminology in Discord, such as the text that would appear on a tooltip 
when hovering the mouse over a button, are written in **bold**.
* Actions and names of features within Discord, such as “channels” or “servers”, are written in *italics*.
* Instructions are written in sequential numbered and lettered lists in order to be easy to follow; 
each section is also self-contained, so you shouldn’t need to read them in any particular order.
* Points of interest within images and screenshots are highlighted with red boxes.

---
## What do you need?

These instructions are for the current version of Windows desktop or browser Discord client as of April 2020. 
We’re using *Windows 10 64-Bit (10.0.18363)*; however, these instructions will likely work with most versions 
of Discord, as its core features rarely change drastically.

All you’ll need for these tutorials is a new or pre-existing Discord account.

Download the Discord desktop app or open the browser client [here](https://discordapp.com/).
