## Voice Settings Configuration
The first step you’ll need to take in your auditory adventure is making sure your settings are laid out exactly how you 
like. There’s nothing worse than being unable to hear your teammates or awkwardly broadcasting your microphone issues 
to the group, so let’s take a look at some key areas of interest within Discord.

### Locating voice settings
From anywhere in the Discord desktop or browser app, navigate to the **User Settings** gear-shaped button in 
the lower left area.

Scroll through the options on the left side, and click on **Voice & Video**.
