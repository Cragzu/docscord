| The Discord app automatically launches upon PC startup (this may be unwanted behaviour) | Discord is set by default to open whenever you turn on your computer; some want this and others don’t. | If you’d rather turn off automatic startup, go to **Windows Settings** under **User Settings** and uncheck **Open Discord** under **System Startup Behavior**.If you’d rather turn off automatic startup, go to **Windows Settings** under **User Settings** and uncheck **Open Discord** under **System Startup Behavior**.|
| Some custom emojis are greyed out and unusable in the **Emoji Picker**                  | You are not a *Discord Nitro* subscriber.                                                              | While nearly all features of Discord are accessible to free users, there are a select few that are limited to premium subscribers (such as the ability to use custom emoji anywhere).

| Your **Push to Talk** key is not enabling your microphone                               | Your keybind may have not been properly recorded, or may have been reset.                              | Re-record your **Push to Talk** keybind.

To find a friend, you’ll need to search for both these things together.                                                                                                                |
