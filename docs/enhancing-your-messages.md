# Enhancing your messages
{: .no_toc }

One of Discord’s main features is the ability to enhance your messages in a fun, but useful way. Between embedding links and images, formatting your messages using markdown, and even using custom emojis, Discord has a versatile arsenal of cool message enhancements.

## 1. Embedding Links and Images
Links and images can be embedded on Discord.

### a) Preventing Links from Showing Previews
One thing about sending links on Discord is that Discord usually gives a preview of the link along with the link itself.

This can be annoying to some users, as they don’t want to see a giant preview of a link covering most of their screen. Luckily, there’s a simple way to avoid that. 

1. Grab a link to any website you wish, and paste it to your message text field.
2. Wrap the link in angle brackets **<>** and send your message.

![New link](https://github.com/Cragzu/docscord/blob/master/assets/images/link_no_embed.png)

As you can see, with the angle brackets, your link is sent as just a hyperlink with no preview embedded onto it. Now you can send links without their previews showing.

### b) Spoilering Images
Uploading images is really easy on Discord, but one thing unique about Discord is their feature to *spoiler* an image. *Spoilering* an image blurs the image, flagging it as a spoiler. Upon clicking the spoilered image, the image will be revealed. This is a very useful function that allows users to share images of potentially spoiler content from a TV show or movie. Spoilering an image is incredibly easy.

1. Choose an image and upload it to a Text Channel or Direct Message.
2. Check off **Mark as Spoiler** on the bottom left.

3. Add a caption if you please, then click **Upload**.

![Spoiler](https://github.com/Cragzu/docscord/blob/master/assets/images/spoiler.png)

As you can see, your image is now blurred. As stated, clicking the spoiler tag will reveal the image.

## 2. Text Formatting
Another cool feature of Discord is the ability for you to use *markdown* in your messages. That means you’re able to bold, italicize, underline, and do much more to your messages. We’ll go over a simple example to bold our message. 

1. Type out your message in your message text field.

![Message](https://github.com/Cragzu/docscord/blob/master/assets/images/message.png)

2. Wrap your message with the required markdown. In our case, we want to bold our message, which requires using two asterisks on each side. You can even see a preview of the newly styled message in the text field.

That's it. There are many more markdown styles to use, which can all be found on [Discord’s official support page.](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)

## 3. Adding Emojis
Discord allows you to upload your own custom emojis to use in a server. Most servers are able to have up to 50 custom emojis (unless you choose to boost it with Discord Nitro). Let’s go over uploading emojis. 

1. Go to your server and click on the dropdown menu button next to your server name on the top-left, shaped like a downwards-pointing arrow. Click **Server Settings**.

2. On the left sidebar, click **Emoji**.

3. Click **Upload Emoji**.

![Upload emoji](https://github.com/Cragzu/docscord/blob/master/assets/images/upload_emoji.png?raw=true)

4. Navigate to the directory on your computer and open your desired image to be used as an emoji.
5. Rename the emoji to whatever you please.

**Note**: Emojis can be at most 256kb in size. Make sure the image you use isn’t too big.

With that. You've now learned about how to take your messaging to the next level on Discord. If you have any problems, remember to consult to the [Troubleshooting](http://chloe-glave.codes/docscord/docs/troubleshooting/) page.
