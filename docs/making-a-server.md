## 1. Creating a Server
Before you dive into the features and customizations, you first need to make the server yourself. Creating a server is very easy.

1. Click the **+** icon on the left bar. (insert image)
2. Click **Create a server**. (insert image)
3. Add a name or an icon if you please, then click **Create**. (insert image)

Voila. You’ve now created your Discord server, and now you can start on customizing it.

## 2. Setting Up Voice and Text Channels
There are two types of channels in a server:
* Text channels which allow you to send messages to a group of users
* Voice channels which allow you to join voice calls with users

---
### a) Creating a Text/Voice Channel

Upon creating a new server, Discord will automatically create one of each. In case you want to add more, we will go over creating and setting up both types. 

1. Right-click your server icon on the left bar and click **Create channel**. (insert image)
2. Select either **Text channel** or **Voice channel**, give the new channel a name*, then click **Create channel*.

**Note:** Channel names may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

---
### b) Adding a description to a Text Channel

You’re able to further customize these channels as you please. For example, text channels can be given descriptions.

1. Hover over the text channel and click the **Edit Settings** button, shaped as a cog. (insert image)
2. Select **Overview** on the left bar, then click on the text field under **Channel Topic**. 
3. Enter in your desired description, then at the bottom of the screen, click **Save Changes**.

### c) Adjusting the Bitrate of a Voice Channel

Voice channels can also be slightly customized. More specifically, you can adjust the *bitrate* of a channel.

1. Hover over the voice channel and click the **Edit Settings button**, shaped as a cog. (insert image)
2. You’ll see a slider menu that corresponds to bitrate. Simply drag the slider button to the desired bitrate. Higher bitrate will result in higher quality voice audio at the cost of requiring a stronger internet connection and vice versa. Once you’ve selected your desired bitrate, click **Save Changes**.

## 3. Inviting Users and Giving them Roles and Permissions

A server doesn’t serve much purpose without users to use it. It’s time to invite some friends to your server. Once you invite them, you also have the option of assigning them custom roles and permissions. 

---
### a) Generating an invite link. 
There are many ways to invite a user to your server, but for the purposes of this task, we will choose to generate an invite link to the server. 

1. Right-click your server icon on the left bar and click **Invite people**. (insert image)
2. A pop-up will appear asking if you wish to invite a friend or create an invite link. You may choose to **copy** the link now and invite your friend, or choose to customize the link and set a maximum time limit or use limit. 
3. Once you’ve copied your link, send it to your friend. This can be done using direct message or through any alternate communication platform.

---
### b) Creating and assigning a role

Now that your friend has arrived, it’s highly suggested you hook them up with some roles, roles allow you to give members specific permissions within the server. For example, maybe you’d like to give your friend permission the ability to delete/pin messages. You must give them a role to give them this ability.

1. Click on the dropdown menu button next to your server name on the top-left, shaped like a downwards-pointing arrow. Click **Server Settings**.
2. On the left sidebar, click **Roles**.
3. To the right of the aforementioned sidebar, click the small **+** symbol. This will create a new role.
4. Select your new role, then scroll down until you find the **Manage Messages** permission. Turn that switch on.
5. Adjust any other permission as you see fit, give your role a name and colour as you wish, then save your changes.
6. Escape out of the settings menu, click the user you wish to assign the newly created role to, click the small **+** button under the roles section of their profile, and select the role to assign it to them.
