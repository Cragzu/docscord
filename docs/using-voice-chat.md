# Using Voice Chat
{: .no_toc }

One of the main features of Discord is chatting with friends over a game, stream, or just for the sake of conversation. 
In this section, we’ll go over the different ways you can utilize voice chat to stay in the loop, and customize your 
settings for the best experience.

## 1. Voice Settings Configuration
The first step you’ll need to take in your auditory adventure is making sure your settings are laid out exactly how you 
like. There’s nothing worse than being unable to hear your teammates or awkwardly broadcasting your microphone issues 
to the group, so let’s take a look at some key areas of interest within Discord.

---
### a) Locating voice settings
From anywhere in the Discord desktop or browser app, navigate to the **User Settings** gear-shaped button in 
the lower left area.

Scroll through the options on the left side, and click on **Voice & Video**.

![Voice & Video menu item](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/locate_voice_video_settings_tab.png?raw=true)

You’ll be presented with a variety of settings; let’s examine two of the most important.

---
### b) Input and output devices

For successful voice communication, you’ll need two things: 
* **Input**, your microphone
* **Output**, your headphones or speakers.

In most cases, Discord will automatically detect your devices (often a headset) so you won’t have to do anything here. 
However, it’s a good idea to double-check that the selected devices are the ones you want; issues with your voice going
unheard are often due to the wrong microphone being selected.

The **Input Device** and **Output Device** sections allow you to select your desired option from the dropdown, 
as well as tweak your incoming and outgoing volume levels.

### c) Voice Activity vs. Push to Talk modes

There are two ways to talk in Discord.
* **Voice Activity** simply transmits your audio constantly, whenever your microphone detects it. This is the default setting.
* **Push to Talk**, for those who prefer a bit more control, allows you to set up a custom hotkey that will activate 
your mic only when held down.

If you prefer to use **Voice Activity**, the only setting you may want to take a look at is your 
**input sensitivity**. It’s best to leave *Automatically determine input sensitivity* on unless you run into 
trouble; this allows Discord to try to even out your volume level depending on the input it’s receiving. 
If this isn’t working for you, try unchecking the box and adjusting the slider manually. 

You’ll want it at a point where the bar is only activated when you’re speaking, but doesn’t go past the slider circle.

**Push to Talk** (PTT) has a few more things to set up, but is still simple to get started with. First of all, 
select it from the dropdown.

You’ll need to tell Discord what *shortcut* (key or combination of keys) you want to activate PTT. This’ll be 
what you hold down whenever you want to transmit your voice. To record your shortcut, simply click on the 
rightmost box and press your desired key(s).

Lastly, examine the PTT *release delay*. This will be the amount of time Discord keeps your microphone active after 
you’ve released the shortcut key. Simply adjust this slider to your preference.

## 2. Direct Message Calls
Now that you’ve finessed all of your settings, it’s time to start a call! Chatting through **direct messages** (DMs) 
is a private, easy way to communicate with only the people you want to be in the call. Between two and ten 
people can be in a DM together. Let’s create one!

---
### a) Creating a Direct Message
First of all, set up a DM channel. This will be your space to privately talk over text and voice 
with only the select few people you want to invite. From the homepage, select the **Friends** tab, 
then click on the **New Group DM** button.

![Create DM button](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/create_dm_button.png?raw=true)

You’ll then be able to choose up to nine friends to add to the DM, either by scrolling through the list or 
typing in their username.

![Add friends to DM](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/dm_select_friends.png?raw=true)

Once you’ve picked all your people, click **Create Group DM**.

---
### b) Initiating a Call

Let’s say you want to be the one to take leadership of the team and start a voice call. 
It’s as simple as pressing a button…

**Caution:** clicking the **Start Voice Call** button will alert everyone in the DM group. 
Be sure you’re ready to go before starting!
{: .fs-5 }

On the upper right side of the DM screen, click **Start Voice Call**.

![Start a call in DM](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/start_dm_call.png?raw=true)

Once someone accepts the call, you’ll be connected! More people can always join in the active call, 
as long as they’re a part of the DM.

---
### c) Handling Incoming Calls

Alternatively, if you’d rather sit back and wait for the calls to roll in (or if someone else beat you to it), 
you can join into an existing call.

When someone in your DM starts a call, you’ll be notified with an alert and ringtone. Join in by clicking 
the green **Join Call** button, and you’re ready to go!

![Join a call in DM](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/join_dm_call.jpg?raw=true)

Once you’re in the call, you’ll notice a few key pieces of iconography.

* A **green ring** around a user’s profile picture means they are actively transmitting audio. 
This is a good way of making sure others can hear you speaking.
* A **crossed-out microphone** means that user has *muted* themselves (they won’t be able to speak)
* **Crossed-out headphones** means that user has *deafened* themselves (they won’t be able to speak or hear any other users)

![Icon meanings in DM call](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/dm_call_iconography.png?raw=true)

You can *mute* or *deafen* yourself by right-clicking your own profile picture and checking or un-checking the boxes in the pop-up.

---
### d) Exiting a Call

All good things must come to an end. When you’re ready to call it quits, just click 
the red **Leave Call** button to exit the call.

![Exit DM call](https://github.com/Cragzu/just-the-docs/blob/master/assets/images/dm_leave_call.png?raw=true)

**Note:** You’ll still need to leave the call even if everyone else has left. 
The voice channel will remain active if there is even one person remaining, allowing others to re-join, 
so don’t forget to exit once you’re done chatting!
