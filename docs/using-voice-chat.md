# Using Voice Chat
{: .no_toc }

One of the main features of Discord is chatting with friends over a game, stream, or just for the sake of conversation. 
In this section, we’ll go over the different ways you can utilize voice chat to stay in the loop, and customize your 
settings for the best experience.

## Voice Settings Configuration
The first step you’ll need to take in your auditory adventure is making sure your settings are laid out exactly how you 
like. There’s nothing worse than being unable to hear your teammates or awkwardly broadcasting your microphone issues 
to the group, so let’s take a look at some key areas of interest within Discord.

### Locating voice settings
From anywhere in the Discord desktop or browser app, navigate to the **User Settings** gear-shaped button in 
the lower left area.

Scroll through the options on the left side, and click on **Voice & Video**.

You’ll be presented with a variety of settings; let’s examine two of the most important.

### Input and output devices

For successful voice communication, you’ll need two things: 
* **Input**, your microphone
* **Output**, your headphones or speakers.

In most cases, Discord will automatically detect your devices (often a headset) so you won’t have to do anything here. 
However, it’s a good idea to double-check that the selected devices are the ones you want; issues with your voice going
unheard are often due to the wrong microphone being selected.

The **Input Device** and **Output Device** sections allow you to select your desired option from the dropdown, 
as well as tweak your incoming and outgoing volume levels.

### Voice Activity vs. Push to Talk modes

There are two ways to talk in Discord.
* **Voice Activity** simply transmits your audio constantly, whenever your microphone detects it. This is the default setting.
* **Push to Talk**, for those who prefer a bit more control, allows you to set up a custom hotkey that will activate 
your mic only when held down.
